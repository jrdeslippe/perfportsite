BoxLib therefore\nincludes geometric multigrid solvers for solving problems which use both\ncell-centered and nodal data. For this project, we have focused on the\ncell-centered solver due to its relative simplicity compared to the nodal\nsolver.  Geometric multigrid is an iterative method for solving linear problems which\ncontains roughly 4 steps:   relaxation  restriction  prolongation  coarse-grid linear solve (either approximate or exact)   Although here we will not discuss the details of the geometric multigrid\nmethod, we summarize each of these steps below as they pertain to computational\nalgorithms.
